# Kotlin Programming Language Overview
This repository provides an overview of the Kotlin programming language, a statically typed programming language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Android, and the browser. Kotlin is designed to be more expressive and concise than Java, with features such as null safety, extension functions, lambdas, and coroutines.
